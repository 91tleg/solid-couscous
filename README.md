## Subaru Select Monitor I Scan Tool
This project recreates Subaruâ€™s first-generation diagnostic tool (SSM1), originally used by dealerships in the 1990s. 
At the time, Subaru relied on a proprietary communication protocol to access ECU data, before OBD-II became mandatory.
The goal of this project is to provide enthusiasts with affordable access to dealer-level diagnostics.

### Features
- Communicates with ECU
- Reads live parameters
- Monitors switch states
- Clears trouble codes
